## Section 1 - Project Description
### Questions
1) What is the distribution of user ratings and reviews for different Android app categories?
   - This question will help us understand the user sentiment towards different types of Android apps. It will also reveal which categories tend to receive higher ratings and more reviews, indicating higher user engagement. Understanding the distribution of user ratings and reviews across app categories is crucial for developers and marketers. Positive reviews and high ratings significantly impact app visibility and trust among potential users. Research has shown that higher ratings lead to increased downloads and user retention.

2) Is there a correlation between app/category and score rating?
   - Analyzing user engagement metrics across different app categories will highlight the areas where users are most active and interested. This information is crucial for developers and marketers to focus their efforts on high-engagement categories. Identifying app categories with the highest user engagement provides valuable insights for developers and marketers looking to target specific demographics or optimize their app offerings. It allows for more targeted marketing efforts and can lead to increased user acquisition and retention.

3) Is there any correlation between the various ratings and the device being an Android or iOS product?
   - This question will help us determine if higher ratings are associated with the device being an Android or an Apple product. It can provide insights into the relationship between device popularity and user satisfaction. Investigating this correlation is essential for developers. It helps them determine if increasing ratings directly translates to higher user satisfaction between product types.

   -[Source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/odins0n/top-20-play-store-app-reviews-daily-update?rvi=1)
   - The second data set is a CSV file containing app reviews of the top twenty Google Play apps. The columns of this data include: app name, the content of the review, the review ID, and the score for each review. We used the groups function in Tableau in order to group the apps by the category they fit into.

## Section 3 - Interpretting Visualizations
### Our Visualizations
1) Average Score Bar Chart [link to visualization](https://public.tableau.com/views/AverageScoreBarChart_17016405678550/Sheet1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
   - This first bar chart shows the average score for each of the twenty apps. We used the app names to color the chart as well, to make it more visually appealing. 

2) Average Score by Category [link to visualization](https://public.tableau.com/views/AverageScorebyCategory/Sheet1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
   - The second chart shows the average score by app category. We used a tree map so the size of the sections could be a nice indicator for the score that each category received.
  
3) Android vs. iOS Ratings [link to visualization](https://public.tableau.com/views/AndroidvsiOSRatings/Sheet1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
